# Hashcode

- Whenever we create an object, JVM will give a unique number to that object.

 In other words, JVM will assign a unique number to the object we created.

 To print the hashcode we have 2 ways:

 1. Print the reference variable

     Ex:

    class Test{

      public static void main(String[] args){
    
        Test t = new Test();
    
        System.out.println(t);
    
              }
    
    }
